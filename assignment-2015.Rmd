# NFS1201: Assignment 3 (Nov. 18th, 2015)

Household food insecurity is a known public health problem in Canada, with an 
associated higher risk for diseases that have a personal and economic cost for 
Canadians (both individually and governmentally). Tackling household food 
insecurity is not a simple action as there are systemic and global 
considerations, as well as limited government resources, often including a lack 
of political willpower. Historically, Canada has not had a strategy specific to 
food insecurity and the current indirect interventions don't seem to be very
effective given that prevalence rates for food insecurity have remained fairly
stable, even increasing in some cases, throughout Canada and so there is a need
for strategies to meaningfully reduce the rates. With the recent election of the
Liberal party to a federal parliamentary majority, there are high hopes and 
spirits that change can be achieved. *There is political willpower* to make 
major changes to health policies and the Liberal party has stated that if need 
be they *will run a deficit* in order to achieve some of their goals.

Jane Philpott, a medical physician, was recently appointed to the Liberal 
cabinet as Minister of Health. The Liberal platform supports developing a 
national strategy to reduce household food insecurity. Imagine Philpott has put 
together a task force to address food insecurity. While multiple strategies will
likely be needed, the task force must prioritize one strategy over others for 
action. As such, the strategy should be impactful and effective. Now imagine you
are recruited as part of that task force to address food insecurity. What 
strategy would you prioritize to help meaningfully reduce household food 
insecurity and why? How would you convince Philpott that your strategy would 
realistically work? Will your strategy focus on individual provinces/territories
or all of Canada? Will your strategy target households who are severely food
insecure or the overall prevalence rates? Given all strategies have potential
issues, what are the limitations of your strategy and how you would
counter-argue or address them?

Drawing on the key concepts learned in class and your review of the evidence, 
your assignment is to outline an intervention strategy to reduce household food 
insecurity in Canada. Identify a clear rationale for your focus, the core 
elements of your intervention, and how your strategy, given your understanding 
of the problem, should reduce household food insecurity. It is expected that you
will critically review literature on food insecurity to develop an 
*evidence-based analysis* of the problem and its potential *realistic* 
solutions. Regardless of the type of strategy you propose, it is important to 
pick something that you can argue persuasively would have a palpable impact on 
household food insecurity.

Your assignment should be approximately 1,200 words in length, not including 
references.  It should be submitted to FitzGerald building room 315 by 5pm on 
Wednesday, Dec. 16th, 2015 (any extension to this deadline will require prior 
approval from the instructor). Assignments should be submitted by hard-copy; 
emailing or faxing are possible subject to instructor approval. **Important**: 
please include a title page, with your name, and start the assignment on the
next page (still double-side the pages).
