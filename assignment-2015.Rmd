# NFS1201: Assignment 3 (Nov. 18th, 2015)

Household food insecurity is a known public health problem in Canada, with an 
associated higher risk for diseases that have a personal and economic cost for 
Canadians (both individually and governmentally). Tackling household food 
insecurity is not a simple action as there are systemic and global 
considerations, as well as limited government resources, often including a lack 
of political willpower. Current interventions don't seem to be very effective 
given that prevalence rates for food insecurity have remained fairly stable, 
even increasing in some cases, throughout Canada and so there is a need for
strategies to meaningfully reduce the rates. With the recent election of the
Liberal party to a federal parliamentary majority, there is high hopes and 
spirits that change can be achieved. *Political willpower is there* to make 
major changes to health policies and the Liberal party has stated that if need 
be they *will run a deficit* in order to achieve some of their goals.

Jane Philpott, a medical physician, was recently appointed to the Liberal 
cabinet as Minister of Health. As part of an overall goal of improving the 
health of Canadians, Philpott has put to together several task forces, one of 
which is specific to reducing household food insecurity. However, an important 
constraint on the task force is that only one, *targeted/focused* strategy can 
be implemented. As such, the strategy should *preferably* be as impactful and as
effective as possible. Imagine you are recruited as part of that task force to
address food insecurity. What policies, programs, or strategies would you
implement to help reduce food insecurity in Canada nationally? Drawing on the
key concepts learned in class and your review of the evidence, outline an
intervention strategy to reduce household food insecurity in Canada. Identify a
clear rationale for the focus, the core elements of the intervention, and how
this strategy, given your understanding of the problem, should reduce household
food insecurity. Without letting it get in the way of developing an effective
intervention, keep in mind potential challenges and barriers (e.g. finances,
marketing, resources) and the type of intervention warranted, e.g. a population
strategy for Canada, targeting 'high risk' provinces or subgroups, focusing
on provinces or areas with most food insecure households (e.g. Ontario and
Quebec), or a combination of approaches.

In doing this assignment, it is expected that you will critically review 
literature on food insecurity to develop an *evidence-based analysis* of the 
problem and its potential solutions. Your proposed intervention approach should 
be *realistic*, meaning that it needs to be evidence-based and clearly grounded in
an analysis of the problem you are trying to fix.

Given the assignment details, you will need to focus on a single intervention
strategy. Regardless of the type of strategy you propose, it is important to
pick something that you can argue persuasively would have a palpable impact on
food insecurity in Canada, the province, or area you focus on.

Your assignment should be approximately 1,200 words in length, not including 
references.  It should be submitted to FitzGerald building room 315 by 5pm on 
Wednesday, Dec. 16th, 2015 (any extension to this deadline will require prior 
approval from the instructor). Assignments should be submitted by hard-copy; 
emailing or faxing are possible subject to instructor approval. **Important**: 
please have your title page, with your name, as a separate page from the rest of
your written assignment.
