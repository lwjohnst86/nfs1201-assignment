Federal policies/interventions/initiatives to lower national rates of severe
food insecure households.

*Strategies for lowering food insecurity with limited resources (financial,
political will/power, etc).
*What would be the most impactful, nationally, way to lower food insecurity? (Or
to lower the health costs (personal and economic) of food insecurity)
*Absolute vs relative for food insecurity (ie: Ontario/Quebec vs Nunavut)
*How could we incorporate other countries successful efforts at reducing food
insecurity?

*If you were able to do only one strategy/intervention/initiative to reduce
health impact of food insecurity, what would it be? (Or maybe to lower food
insecurity in general).
*What are some grass-roots efforts that could be initiated (outside of government
involvement) that would be effective at reducing household food insecurity?
*Given the systemic challenges and barrier involved in food insecurity, how could
you as an individual or a local organization improve the health of those who are
food insecure?

From a public health perspective, is reducing food insecurity a valid or
cost-effective strategy for reducing the disease burden on Canadian citizens
and on the Canadian healthcare system.

*How would you revamp all Canadian federal/provincial policies/programs that
directly or indirectly help reduce food security? What would you include, what
would you remove?

How would you overhaul the food bank/food charity system?

How cost-effective and total effective are community oriented approaches to
reducing food insecurity (community gardens, food kitchens, food banks,
subsidized food box programs, etc.).
